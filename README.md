# NOTE (for those who use Edge or Chromium-based browsers)

Some browsers, like Edge, may say that my compiled programs are "malicious." You can check the source code. This usually happens because the compiled .exe doesn't have a signature.

# What I like to do in my free time

I love playing TF2, animating in Source Filmmaker, and editing videos in DaVinci Resolve. I also code sometimes.

# Music

I like to make music in LMMS with MIDI. You can find them here: https://youtube.com/channel/UCg0oh7mDOinFlMXJS1Q1v_A
